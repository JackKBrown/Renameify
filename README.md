# Renameify
simple tool to recursively prepend and or append text to filenames


## TODO LIST

* 3. The preview should have ticky boxes so you can not apply it to specific files. 

## DONE LIST

### V0.2 21-01-21
* File > exit works now
* Clicking the box left of  "select" showing folder path should function like clicking select. (So when left side of window is shrunk, it's still functional)
* named the thing which appears in the window-top appropriately
* Align the left size of the prepend and append typey boxes with each other.
* Added a toggle button to turn on/off the path to the file at the right.
* auto preview
* In the select menu, clicking cancel should retain the previously entered folder instead of remove it. 
* There should be a exclude box to auto make it not apply to files with specified text in
* Added find replace function
